      <description>I have more than 10 years of experience in the field of urban climate and building energy efficiency. I have essentially studied interactions between buildings and their outdoor environment using both experimental and modelling approaches. I have conducted various field experiments in the outdoor built environment using automatic weather stations, meteorological flux towers, and infrared thermal cameras. Data I have collected through fields experiments have been used to either validate physically-based models or train data-driven models.</description>

      <description>I received my Bachelor and Master degree in Computer Science at the University of Geneve (Switzerland). At the end of my Master, I wrote a thesis about humain-machine interactions using brain waves.&#xA;As a first professional experience in research, I worked at the Energy Center of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne. I was hired in a project to study energy flows in Switzerland. The project enabled me to realize the importance of buildings in the total consumption of energy within a country.</description>

      <description>Teaching has always been a rewarding experience, allowing me to share my knowledge with students while also learning from them in return. For this reason, I adhere to the active learning pedagogical approach to ensure that students receive the most effective knowledge transfer from me. My dedication to active learning originates from a reflection on my education and pedagogical training. I primarily followed an academic curriculum in Switzerland and Singapore, where a passive learning pedagogical approach prevailed during my studies.</description>

      <description>To date, my research has primarily focused on building energy performance and urban overheating, utilizing physics-based models of thermal interactions between buildings and their outdoor environment. In light of findings reported in various studies12, I have come to realize that urban decarbonization must extend beyond building energy performance to effectively mitigate climate change. For this reason, I have recently developed an interest in assessing the potential of new building materials and urban designs to transform cities into carbon sinks.</description>

      <description>For the past five years, I have studied monitoring approaches to observe factors contributing to and mitigating urban overheating. During my tenure at a collaborative research alliance between the University of California Berkeley (UCB) and the National University of Singapore (NUS), I reviewed approaches relying on infrared thermography1 and established Singapore&amp;rsquo;s first rooftop observatory for neighborhood-scale studies2. The rooftop observatory served as the foundation for a project administered by NUS, in which I participate as a research collaborator (see the link here).</description>
