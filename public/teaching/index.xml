      <description>Teachning is not only a way for me to tranfer the knowledge I acquired in the fields of computer and building sciences, but also an opprtunity to learn from others. For that reason, I highly encourage students to actively participate in class rather than passively listening to the instructor. Through active learning, I am able to evaluate student&amp;rsquo;s entry level at the early stage of the course, provide adequate feedback and guidance at each important stage of their learning curve, and ensure they will achieve their learning objectives at the end of their curriculum.</description>
