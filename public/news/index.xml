      <description>During the PLEA 2024 international conference in Wroclaw (Poland), I presented preliminary results obtained from detailed building energy models coupled with a data driven urban canopy model. It includes the validation of the coupled scheme and a baseline-scenarios analysis. My presentation was on June 26 2024 between 12:40pm and 12:50pm CET. The content of the presentation is available here.</description>

      <description>On June 17 2024 between 10:30am and 12pm EST, I gave a talk on applications of machine learning to urban building energy modelling and climate risk assessment during the Climate Change AI seminar series. This session comprised a 30-minute presentation on my past experience and current research and a 45-minute discussion on the following topics:&#xA;Computer science and physics to study urban sustainability Machine learning to predict outdoor conditions Machine learning to calibrate an urban building energy model Machine learning to assess climate risk The content of the presentation can be found here.</description>
