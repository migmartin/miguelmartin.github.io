In this course, I teach fundamental notions in Building Physics and their applications using EnergyPlus. I also provide guidance to students in their assignments and final group projects. I contributed to the course material for the following lectures:
- Lecture 5: Energy Use in Buildings ([Slides](/teaching/CEECMU12770/12-770_Lecture_5_BuildingPhysics_Energy_Use_in_Buildings.pdf))
- Lecture 6: Thermodynamics Part 1 ([Slides](/teaching/CEECMU12770/12-770_Lecture_6_BuildingPhysics_Thermodynamics_Part_1.pdf))
- Lecture 7: Thermodynamics Part 2 ([Slides](/teaching/CEECMU12770/12-770_Lecture_7_BuildingPhysics_Thermodynamics_Part_2.pdf))
- Lecture 8: Thermal comfort ([Slides](/teaching/CEECMU12770/12-770_Lecture_8_BuildingPhysics_Thermal_Comfort.pdf))
- Lecture 9: Building Energy Simulations Part 1 ([Slides](/teaching/CEECMU12770/12-770_Lecture_9_Building_Energy_Simulations_Part_1.pdf), [ZIP](/teaching/CEECMU12770/material_part_1.zip), [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL17rJuX4QCblKZgSvASJJoTpWtYsJhuON))
- Lecture 10: Building Energy Simulations Part 2 ([Slides](/teaching/CEECMU12770/12-770_Lecture_10_Building_Energy_Simulations_Part_2.pdf), [ZIP](/teaching/CEECMU12770/material_part_2.zip), [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL17rJuX4QCblKZgSvASJJoTpWtYsJhuON))
