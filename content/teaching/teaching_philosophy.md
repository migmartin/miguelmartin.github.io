Teachning is not only a way for me to tranfer the knowledge I acquired in the fields of computer and building sciences, but also an opprtunity to learn from others. For that reason, I highly encourage students to actively participate in class rather than passively listening to the instructor. Through active learning, I am able to evaluate student's entry level at the early stage of the course, provide adequate feedback and guidance at each important stage of their learning curve, and ensure they will achieve their learning objectives at the end of their curriculum. At the same time, I always hope that discussions I have with students will motivate me in exploring new aspects of my research that I have not considered so far.

In teaching, as well as in life, time is a resource that must be managed wisely. I therefore believe it is to students' benefit to spend more time on less notions. During that time, I try to give students the opportunity to be wrong so that they can better assess their knowledge or skill gaps. By giving more time to students to learn certain notions or to improve some skills, I also expect they acquire a solid knowledge and expertise that will be useful to them over their career in academia or industry.

Teaching should not be limited to knowledge transfer or skill development. It should also offer students the chance to know more about the fields or topics in which they can be creative. The more creativity is promoted and encourage during teaching, the more students can discover research they could conduct or businesses they could lead. As an instructor and researcher, I also benefit from creative learning activities I proposed to students. They enable me to remain updated on the latest advancements in my research field and the most modern tools used in industry.
