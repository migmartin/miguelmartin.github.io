The Baselining, Evaluating, Action, and Monitoring (BEAM) project is part of the CoolNUS initiative by the NUS president, University Campus Infrastructure (UCI), and College of Design and Engineering (CDE) to develop a test bed for urban microclimate sensing and modelling.

The project aims at developing a city digital twin of an university campus in Singapore. The city digital twin platform consists of 3D city models and weather data that can be used to test various urban microclimate models. As a collaborator of the project, I use data collected throughout the university campus to train grey box models using machine learning. From the models, it is expected to simulate interactions between buildings and their outdoor conditions at the neighbourhood scale.
