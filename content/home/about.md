I have more than 10 years of experience in the field of urban climate and building energy efficiency. I have essentially studied interactions between buildings and their outdoor environment using both experimental and modelling approaches. I have conducted various field experiments in the outdoor built environment using automatic weather stations, meteorological flux towers, and infrared thermal cameras. Data I have collected through fields experiments have been used to either validate physically-based models or train data-driven models. Using the models, I have performed various analysis at the building and neighbourhood scale to predict the impact of urban heat islands on building energy consumption and to evaluate various countermeasures. The main objective of the analysis has been to show architects how to make buildings more energy effective and urban planners how to make cities more environmentally sustainable.
