I have more than 12 years of research experience in building energy efficiency and urban overheating. To investigate their connections, I have integrated sensing, physics, and artificial intelligence across multiple scales, different climates, and various urban morphologies. The sensing methods are automatic weather stations, meteorological flux towers, and infrared thermal cameras. The data collected via these methods serves to either validate physics-based models or train data-driven models. Using the models, I aim to evaluate various strategies to counteract urban overheating and reduce the carbon footprint in cities.
