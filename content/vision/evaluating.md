Models of thermal and carbon interactions between buildings and their outdoor environment offer a promising perspective for evaluating strategies that reduce building energy consumption and increase urban carbon sequestration. They can thus form the basis of support tools for scientists, industry leaders, and policymakers to create a comprehensive city decarbonization roadmap aligned with Paris Agreement targets. To develop such tools and become a world leader in climate-neutral and smart cities, I am seeking research collaborations. My initial objective is to collaborate with Building Material Science researchers to quantify the potential for carbon sequestration by timber and innovative building materials. Subsequently, I intend to collaborate with Urban Planning experts to investigate urban design strategies that incorporate vegetation for maximized outdoor thermal comfort and carbon sequestration.

Beyond urban sustainability, I aim to achieve scientific recognition in the field of building heat resilience. According to Hong et al. [^1], achieving building heat resilience demands knowledge across Energy Systems and Human Behavior, in addition to understanding thermal interactions between buildings and their outdoor environment. For this reason, I would welcome the opportunity to collaborate with specialists in these two fields.
