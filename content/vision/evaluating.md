Models of thermal and carbon interactions between buildings and their outdoor environment offer a promising perspective for evaluating strategies that reduce building energy consumption and increase urban carbon sequestration. They can thus form the basis of support tools for scientists, industry leaders, and policymakers to create a comprehensive city decarbonization roadmap aligned with Paris Agreement targets. To develop such tools, and become a world leader in climate-neutral and smart cities, I am seeking for research collaborations. First, I would like to collaborate with scientists in Building Material Science to determine the amount of carbon that can potentially be captured by timber and new building materials. Subsequently, I intend to collaborate with experts in Urban Planning to investigate urban design strategies that incorporate vegetation to maximize outdoor thermal comfort and carbon sequestration.

Beyond urban sustainability, I would like to gain authority in building heat resilience. As stated by Hong et al. [^1], building heat resilience requires knowledge in Energy Systems and Human Behaviour, in addition to thermal interactions between buildings and their outdoor environment. For this reason, I would be interested in collaborating with specialists in these two fields.
