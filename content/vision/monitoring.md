For the past five years, I have studied monitoring approaches to observe factors contributing to and mitigating urban overheating. During my tenure at a collaborative research alliance between the University of California Berkeley (UCB) and the National University of Singapore (NUS), I reviewed approaches relying on infrared thermography[^1] and established Singapore's first rooftop observatory for neighborhood-scale studies[^2]. The rooftop observatory served as the foundation for a project administered by NUS, in which I participate as a research collaborator (see the link [here](https://www.coolnus-beam.sg/)). It was also used as a reference to collect thermal images of the outdoor built environment at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) campus (see the link [here](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/c5fb8062-af5d-491a-8faf-8be7fc390f48)). My expertise in monitoring urban overheating is currently being sought by [Rowan Williams Davis and Irvin Inc.](https://rwdi.com/en_ca/).

Building on this expertise, my objective is to observe urban carbon sources and sinks. I plan to deploy large sensor networks to analyze carbon concentration in several built environments. While valuable, sensor networks are one of many monitoring approaches. To enhance multiscale observations, I intend to explore approaches using satellites and mobile systems as well. Multiscale observations of urban carbon sources and sinks could be used for a better assessment of urban carbon footprint in future investigations[^3].
