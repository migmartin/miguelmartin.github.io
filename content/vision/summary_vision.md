To date, my research has primarily focused on building energy performance and urban overheating, utilizing physics-based models of thermal interactions between buildings and their outdoor environment. In light of findings reported in various studies[^1][^2], I have come to realize that urban decarbonization must extend beyond building energy performance to tackle climate change. Through my participation in the [PLEA 2024 conference](https://plea2024.pl/) and review of recent scientific contributions in urban sustainability [^3][^4], I have come to understand that new building materials and urban designs possess the potential to transform cities into carbon sinks. Although carbon sink strategies offer new perspectives to accelerate urban decarbonization, I observed that limited data and simulation tools are available for assessing their efficacy in capturing carbon dioxide in the outdoor air. This observation enabled me to sharpen my research vision on urban sustainability around three pillars:
1. Developing novel monitoring approaches, drawing on my expertise in large sensor networks and thermal cameras, to detect sources and sinks of heat and carbon dioxide at multiple scales within a city;
2. Leveraging physics-based modeling and machine learning to accurately and effectively simulate thermal and carbon interactions between buildings and their outdoor environments at multiple scales, in different climates, and for various applications; and
3. Utilizing data and models to assess the capabilities of new building materials and urban designs in reducing energy consumption in cities and transforming them into carbon sinks.

The figure below depicts my research vision, which builds upon my past research and charts a path toward becoming a leading expert in climate-neutral and smart cities.
