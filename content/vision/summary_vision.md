To date, my research has primarily focused on building energy performance and urban overheating, utilizing physics-based models of thermal interactions between buildings and their outdoor environment. In light of findings reported in various studies[^1][^2], I have come to realize that urban decarbonization must extend beyond building energy performance to effectively mitigate climate change. For this reason, I have recently developed an interest in assessing the potential of new building materials and urban designs to transform cities into carbon sinks. To determine the efficacy of carbon sink strategies in accelerating urban climate neutrality, I wish to address three critical questions: 
1. What monitoring approaches can be used to observe urban carbon sources and sinks?
2. What models are suitable for predicting urban carbon concentration across various scales and climates?
3. What strategies can be used to enhance building energy performance and carbon sequestration in cities?

The figure below depicts my planned approach to addressing these questions, which builds upon my past research and charts a path toward becoming a leading expert in climate-neutral and smart cities.
