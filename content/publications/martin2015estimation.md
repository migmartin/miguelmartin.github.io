abstract = "In this paper, we describe a lumped thermal parameter model coupled with an EnergyPlus model used for estimating temperature and specific humidity in the near-surface urban environment. Estimations made by the model are compared to measurements obtained from data loggers installed in an urban canyon of Masdar Institute (Abu Dhabi). Based on these comparisons, we first evaluate the most likely ratios of heat released into the urban canyon by a building air handling unit and the wind tower that produces adiabatically cooled air. Next, we analyze three specific case studies to obtain a local estimate of the accuracy that is reached by the coupled scheme. To estimate its global precision, we perform a sensitivity and Monte-Carlo analysis over the most likely ratios of heat emitted by the air handling unit and the wind tower. Although validation in a dense downtown is still lacking and will be undertaken in the future, this study suggests that urban temperature and humidity can be estimated with an acceptable accuracy under moderate waste heat releases and anthropogenic heat gains."
