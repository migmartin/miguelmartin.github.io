abstract = "Urban Building Energy Models (UBEMs) often ignore interactions between buildings and their outdoor conditions. To determine their importance when calibrating an UBEM, this study performed various statistical analyses using a coupling between detailed building energy models and a data driven urban canopy model. Results of statistical analyses suggest that the sensitivity of an UBEM with respect to uncertain parameters is affected by interactions between buildings and their outdoor conditions. They also reduce the probability to reach requirements for calibration. The reason is that interactions between buildings and their outdoor conditions are an important factor driving the goodness-of-fit of an UBEM."
