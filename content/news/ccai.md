On **June 17 2024 between 10:30am and 12pm EST**, I will give a talk on applications of machine learning to urban building energy modelling and climate risk assessment during the Climate Change AI seminar series. This session will comprise a 30-minute presentation on my past experience and current research and a 45-minute discussion on the following topics:
- Computer science and physics to study urban sustainability
- Machine learning to predict outdoor conditions
- Machine learning to calibrate an urban building energy model
- Machine learning to assess climate risk
