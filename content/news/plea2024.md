During the PLEA 2024 international conference in Wroclaw (Poland), I presented preliminary results obtained from detailed building energy models coupled with a data driven urban canopy model. It includes the validation of the coupled scheme  and a baseline-scenarios analysis. My presentation was on **June 26 2024 between 12:40pm and 12:50pm CET**. The content of the presentation is available [here](/news/Presentation_Miguel_Martin_Fehlmann_METHOD_1-1407_Mission_Adaptation_5.pdf).
