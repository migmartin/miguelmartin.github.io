Between **September 10 and 12 2024**, I am planning to present my research on the use of machine learning to simulate interactions between buildings and their outdoor conditions during the GNI Symposium & Expo on Artificial Intelligence for the Built World in Munich. The content of the presentation is available [here](/news/9792_Miguel_Martin_MACHINE_LEARNING_TO_SIMULATE_INTERACTIONS_BETWEEN_BUILDINGS_AND_THEIR_OUTDOOR_CONDITIONS.pdf).
